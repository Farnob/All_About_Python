#Here we will talk about Data Types in Python

'''
Data types are the classification or categorization of knowledge items. It represents the type useful that tells what operations are often performed on specific data. Since everything is an object in Python programming, 
    N.B => data types are classes and variables are instances (object) of those classes.

    primarilly there are following data types in python
        1.Integers
        2.Floating Point Numbers
        3.Strings
        4.Booleans
        5.None --> {None is used to define a null value. It is not the same as an empty string, False, or a zero. It is a data type of the class NoneType object. Assigning a value of None to a variable is one way to reset it to its original, empty state.}

d = True
e = None
print(type(a))
print(type(b))
print(type(c))
print(type(d))
print(type(e))
